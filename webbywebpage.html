            Overview
        </h2>
        <section class="subsection">
        <p>
            Well, if you're reading this you probably thought becoming a builder was a fantastic idea. Well you're wrong.
             Its a terrible idea. We're here to tell you exactly why that is. If you've been harbouring thoughts of big bucks, horny 
             housewives,
             tax rebates and a general Life of Riley, we are here to put those myths to bed once and for all. Read on for more insights
              into the cess
            pit of sheer idiocy that the building trade has become and, why you should avoid getting involved at all costs...
        </p>
        </section>
        <h2>So, what exactly is going on with the building trade?</h2>
            <section class="double-section">        
            
        <p class="thin-para1">Everybody seems to think that builders make $$$$$$$ but that really isnt the case at all. Think about it, 
            you have to go to the job at least twice before you even get it, once to look at it and get an idea, once to have a proper 
            look to get all the bits you forgot to look at last time you were
            there, because you're a numpty. Then you've gotta 'get the gear'. <br><br>This usually involves a 'McBreakfast' of some description
             because you were too lazy to cook any proper breakfast that morning,
            then, when you get to the merchants, you realise that since covid, every merchant and his dog has decided they can really 
            take the mickey and have doubled the cost of everything.<br><br> Absolutely everything.<br><br> Even stuff that has no business going up in 
            price
            like those little pencils they have on the counter with 'acme builders merchants' engraved on em that snap the first time 
            you use em. <br>Its just not worth it, trust me.<br> You then realise you've gone and underquoted the job so you drive over to the
             punters
            house feeling like a bag of crap cos you know you're gonna make sod all out of this job. <br>Then the punter starts moaning that
             'well you said you were gonna do x,y and z' on top of what you've quoted for. Well you can't remember cos you'd had a 
             couple of beers before you went round and gave em the quote, and you know what you're like when you've had a few.. get 
             all charitable and that so now you gotta do all that too.. for free.. numpty.<br>
            Telling you, its just not worth it. Dont do it. Simples. It's not just since covid that this has been going on.<br> This absolute pigs ear of a calamity of a business 
            model
            has been brewing for the last 40 years. Ever since Maggie 'the milk snatcher' Thatcher kicked the miners front door in and
             threatened
            to cut off their winkles if they dared to ask for a pay rise, the entire construction industry has been absolutely shitting 
            itself. 
        </p>
        <p id="thisbox"class="thin-para2">
            Back in the 90's we had the 'White Gold' rush where everyone was running round shoving cheap plastic windows in every hole 
            they could find 
            but even those days are sadly behind us.<br> You could jump on the 'Air Source Heat Pump (sponsored by 
            <button id="rishibutton" onclick="playSound()">rishi sunak</button>)bandwagon but good luck with that one,            
            the bloody things just dont work. At all. 
            <a href="https://www.grundfos.com/uk/learn/research-and-insights/coefficient-of-system-performance#:~:text=The%20Co%2Defficient%20of%20performance,W" target="_blank">COP</a>
             3? My arse. The only way you'll get a COP of 3 is in the middle of summer when you dont actually need the bloody thing. 
             In the dead of winter, when you DO actually need it that Ace No.1 performance rating drops like a pisshead in a boxing match. It's cheaper to burn your
              life savings in the hearth.<br> The problem is, nobody has had a pay rise in the building industry since Yosser Hughes was last heard
              shouting "Gis a Job!" on every building site in the north and thats largely down to Tory policy.<br> It goes something like this:<br> <br>
              1. Allocate 0.5% annual budget to building more houses.<br> 2. Give large lucrative contracts to your mates.<br>3. These 'friends of the prime 
              minister' then go find the local tory councillor and offer em a slice in return for a kickback.<br> <br>Said councillor then offers up some kind
              of 'Development Grant' to local landlords who he's a bit pally with (b'cos he's got a few rentals himself) and these guys
              go looking for some mug to clean the mould off the bedsit walls some single mother is trying to bring a kid up in.
              You then come along with your polished looking 'Schedule of works', he gives it to all the other numpties telling them 'Beat that quote and its 
              yours mate', until finally the job gets done by Sid the dosser for 20 quid and a bag of chips.<br>(Sid doesn't care, he's got his dole
              money, his PIP and he doesnt have to pay tax on a cash job).<br> <br>This is gonna be your life.<br>Quoting against the lowest bidder, thinking the standard of your work
              makes you 'stand out from the crowd'. Don't kid yourself...

        <h3>The people you're gonna meet..</h3>
        <br>
        <h4  id="moaner">The 'Moaner'</h4>
        <p>The Moaner - Yep, theres always one. The one for whom nothing is ever good enough, never mind its free, at taxpayers expense, has been organised and set out and planned for months to be done a certain way with certain materials in a certain time frame etc. He will spend hours on the phone, writing letters of complaint. Will never offer you a cup of tea and sometimes wont even let you in the property to carry out the work. Eventually the council or housing association will have to assign a liason officer to come and listen to his gripes, once a day at least. Even when you’ve finished the immediate area of properties and gone onto the next street. Somebody give this guy a government job running the waste collection department please?</p>
        <br><a href="#topOfPage">Back to the top</a><br><br>
        <h4 id="tart">The 'Tart'</h4>
        <p >The local bike - You know the old cliche? handyman knocks at the door, woman answers in a negligee? Yep, its really a thing. Every council estate has one. She’ll be all hair eyes and teeth, flashing her tits, bending over in a short skirt, giving you the wink… the full shebang… She will try it on with just about anything with a meatstick and a hi vis vest. Usually mid 40’s or thereabouts, not too bad looking if you’ve had a few down the pub, probably a 3 pinter… Now, if we’ve done the “digs” thing with the “dodgy geezer”, we’ll all be staying locally and drinking down the local pub in the evenings… guess who’s gonna rock up… By the end of the job she’ll have been through at least 4 of the lads…</p>
        <br><a href="#topOfPage">Back to the top</a><br><br>
        <h4  id="pisshead">The 'Pisshead'</h4>
        <p>The Pisshead - Typically you’ll have to knock him out of bed in the morning you’re due to start work even though hes been told 3 times the previous 3 days that were gonna be there at 8am sharp. Door opens and a bleary eyed, guilty looking bloke lets you in. The thing is, this guy is great to work for, doesn’t give a shit. not one tiny little bit. “you just crack on lads ill stay out of your way” and he does… retires to the corner and watches you happily smiling away from behind a can of tennants super, constantly asking you if you want one. He’ll even pop out and buy all the lads on the job fish and chips at dinner time. You could leave his house looking like a worse shit tip than it was before and he will THANK you for it. When you leave he will insist on giving you a couple of 4 packs of his favourite tipple as a thankyou, Bless em.</p>
        <br><a href="#topOfPage">Back to the top</a><br><br>
        <h4  id="foreman">The 'Foreman'</h4>
        <p>The Foreman - this guy will get in your way all day telling you how he used to do our kind of work until something “happened” like he had a life changing injury or somesuch and will spend the entire day telling you “you don’t wanna do it like that, you wanna do it like this”… now Im not saying we don’t listen to people who know better but this guy hasn’t got a bloody clue what hes banging on about. Not only that but he will follow you around for the rest of the contract offering his little titbits of advice thinking hes doing you a favour… don’t be that guy.</p>
        <br><a href="#topOfPage">Back to the top</a><br><br>
        <h4 id="geezer">The 'Dodgy Geezer'</h4>
        <p >The Dodgy Geezer - You know the one - bit of this bit of that, never worked an honest day in his life… you’ll spend days trying to get “knocked in” to his property to book the job in, mainly because he’s never actually there, because he’s living with his girlfriend, usually somewhere else on the estate, collecting his dole money (welfare check) and getting his rent paid but the house remains empty. The thing to do was wait for the postman on “giro day” (when the welfare check comes through the post) and keep an eye on the property. He’ll usually show up around 11 or lunchtime to pick up his giro and then you can pounce on him. The good thing about this guy is you can offer him 20 quid a week to “rent” his property (seeing as he isn’t using it) and all the lads get cheap digs cos we’re usually working away and paying through the nose down the local travel inn. Happy days. Once we’ve made contact he’ll be back every 2 or three days with a list of dodgy gear to sell us… tools (probably stolen from another team of contractors not too far away), video recorders (this was back in the day) colour tv’s you name it… a constant source of errrr.. dodgy stuff. Still, cheap digs eh?</p>
        <br><a href="#topOfPage">Back to the top</a><br><br>
        <h4 id="benefits">The 'Benefits family'</h4>
        <p>The “benefits” family - Usually a single mother but sometimes with a husband. Neither work and they have a football side of kids. Like the full set. Age range 2 - 18. You have to move tons of stuff out of the way to get to do what you need to do whilst they just sit and watch you. Its their stuff. Its everywhere. Oh and they’ve got the lot. Big flat screen tv, top of the range stereo, brand new microwave oven, massive trampoline in the garden, you get the picture. Never offer you a cup of tea but 8 of em will line up on their 2 leather sofas mightily interested in what your doing all sipping away at there cup of tea. So one day I’ve got this huge window with a huge pane of glass that I have to remove to fit the new window. They’re all sat 4 feet away. “I have to ask you to leave the room in case there’s an issue when we remove this glass” I says…. “Oh It’s ok we don’t mind” they chorus… Now I can get these out safely normally by cutting a mullion and removing the glass piece by piece but today… well I just stuck a lump hammer through it and boy… fastest they’ve moved all year :D Another time we had the not offering us a cup of tea thing in the middle of summer and we’re building them an extension out the back, so we made up some excuse as we had to turn the water off at the mains. Did so. Left it off for two days.</p>
        <br><a href="#topOfPage">Back to the top</a><br><br>
        <h4 id="stig">'Stig of the dump'</h4>
        <p>Stig of the dump - This guy deserves a special mention. Every so often you’re gonna come across someone with absolutely no sense of personal or otherwise hygiene whatsoever. I mean this guy needs help. This particular guy did actually manage to get some help. We had to report him to the council. He was a public health and fire risk…..

            So, we’re on a block of flats up manchester way. We have a kind of mobile scaffold called a “mastclimber”. Its basically a platform the width of the building that rides up 2 columns of steel, bolted to the building, so we start at the top and work down. 7 windows per flat, 4 flats per floor. We also need to be on the inside to work. We just cant get into this guy. No ones ever seen him. We letter bomb him several times and eventually get a phone call… He’ll leave the balcony door unlocked in the morning, we can just hop off the mast climber onto the balcony and crack on. “No worries mate, we’ll just pull the balcony door to when we’re done, not like you gonna get robbed 9 floors up is it?”
            
            Morning, geared up, on the platform, up we go, over the balcony, look through the balcony window… or try to… wt actual F? I swear I have never seen a property like this… stuff is piled up 6 feet high.. all over… I mean luckily the balcony door opened outwards and out spills… just… everything… its like a cross between a jumble sale, a car boot sale and the local landfill. We actually have to SHOVEL our way in…
            
            The first thing that hits us is the STENCH… I mean there were flies in there shaking our hands thanking us for letting them out on there way out the door.. The first thing we do is kind of half climb, half scramble over this… landfill… gloves on of course… and open all the windows… then bug out for an hour and let the place air a bit it was that bad…
            
            But we have to crack on… start with the balcony, rip that out, its a door with a window and panel below, full height so of course we’ve had to shovel this lot back into the flat to give us some room… on with the rest. The bedroom - well youve got this “bed” if you can call it that, something out of a horror film, dirty (and I mean DIRTY) underwear all over the place, not sure if he actually slept in this crypt but hey ho… crash that one in. Someone need to take a leak. Theres no window in the bathroom but someone needs the bog. The bloke has blocked the bog with shit and bogroll and rather that clear the blockage, he’s just started using the bath… as a bog… number 2’s… I shit you not (sorry). Dont think the basins ever been used. The hallway to the front door had this kind of “corridor” within a corridor consisting of newspaper dating back 30 years it seems.. The kitchen… a sight to behold… you enter through the door almost (not quite) at floor level and as you approach the window you’re traversing a slope of landfill up to cill height so you’re literally stood on years worth of kitchen waste trying to remove the old window sashes. I pick up some sort of plastic bag out of my way, turns out to be what was once, possibly, a bag of potatoes but were now a kind of greenish liquid… nobody DARE open the fridge… must have had a sink in there too somewhere… couldn’t see it…
            
            The funniest thing, we thought, was the lounge area, where the balcony door was. We hadn’t paid it much detailed attention due to the amount of crap in there but we sort of figured out there was a kind of logic to the layout. If you followed the lowest point, like a kind of path through the detritus (it really is piled 6 feet high) you sort of rounded a corner and behold! there’s like this little “cockpit” area… Consists of - an old threadbare armchair with walls built from vhs videos opposite the old crt tv (sat about 5 feet off the floor on more video boxes). Turns out, on closer inspection, just about every single one of these videos is a porn film. There’s just the tv, a video recorder (player too obviously), a mountain (literally) of porn and just enough room for him to settle and wipe himself off with what looked like his “old” clothes? That is it. thats his life. Gets up (peels himself up?) goes to work, comes home, eats his takeaway and beats himself half to death? Some life…
            function playSound(url) {
                const audio = new Audio(url);
                audio.play();
              }
            Anyway, whilst we’ve been shovelling the crap out of the way, about maybe 4 feet down one of the lads comes across a brand new hammer…. “He aint gonna miss this, thats for sure, probably forgot it existed”.. so its now in the back of one of our vans… We fit the last frame (balcony), gun up (without licking our finger to wipe the silicon i might add) shovel the crap back against the frame so he can get to his porn station that evening, close the door and leave….
            
            Weirdest thing? In the morning we get a call from the clerk of works (the council bloke who’s responsible for us reprobates doing our job right and passing the work off)…. We’ve had a complaint from one of the tennants… “oh really? who”… “the bloke you fitted yesterday, he wants his hammer back!”…
            
            Well we had to grass him up for that one didn’t we…
            
            Next thing we know, the actual council, people that are employed directly by the council rock up and ask if they can commandeer our south facing mastclimber for the day… “no worries, we’re on the east side today mate”… and a huge 40 cubic yard roll on-roll off skip rocks up at the bottom of the block. About 6 council workers spent an entire day loading this blokes crap out of the flat onto the platform and deposited it in this huge skip. It filled the skip. It was a ONE bedroom flat. I think they rehoused him into sheltered accommodation after that, we never did get to see him…
